# 🌠 Motion Graphics with Three.js: Falling Flowers & Starfield Animation 

This project showcases dynamic **motion graphics** using **Three.js** in a **React environment**. It consists of two interactive visual effects:  

 - **🌸 Falling Flowers Animation** – A mesmerizing rain of flowers that smoothly falls across the screen, offering a soothing and natural aesthetic.  
 -  **✨ Interactive Starfield** – A stunning starry sky that reacts to mouse movement, creating a dynamic parallax effect.  

## 🎨 Features  

- **Realistic Falling Motion** – Objects (flowers) move naturally with randomized speeds and rotations.  
- **Full-Screen Starfield** – Thousands of stars dynamically rendered for a deep-space feel.  
- **Mouse Interaction** – Move your cursor to subtly rotate the starfield for an immersive experience.  
- **Optimized Performance** – Uses WebGL-powered Three.js for smooth rendering and responsiveness.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **React** – Frontend framework for rendering the components.  
- **Three.js** – 3D rendering library for animations.  
- **JavaScript** – Core language used for the logic and interactions.
